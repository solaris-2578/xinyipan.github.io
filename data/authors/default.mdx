Welcome to my tech blog, where curiosity meets data science! 

I'm passionate about continuous learning and problem-solving in data science. Beyond data, I enjoy photography, electronic rock music, visiting museums and galleries, reading, and traveling. I currently live in Washington State, where the stunning landscapes of the Pacific Northwest offer great inspiration for my landscape photography.

Through this blog, I aim to share practical insights and lessons learned from my journey in data science, focusing on experimentation, causal inference, and privacy-preserving AI. 

I hope you find these topics as exciting as I do! Join me on this learning adventureâ€”feel free to share your thoughts and insights in the comments!
